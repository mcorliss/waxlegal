This blog began as the final project for the Spring 2025 [AI Safety and Ethics Course](https://www.aisafetybook.com/virtual-course) offered by the [Center for AI Safety](https://safe.ai/).

The idea was to engage directly with US Federal lawmakers to encourage thought and action around AI safety, drawing from the topics covered in that course, and then to report my process here to help others who might want to try a similar approach to advancing AI safety through policy.

Many thanks to CAIS for sponsoring the course, and to the facillitator other students in my small-group members for their feedback on this project, and their thoughtful discussion throughout the course.
