There's a lot of AI legislation going on.  Or at least, a lot of legislative buzz: working groups, frameworks, proposed bills.  Less clear how much will actually make it into law.

Multistate.ai, which tracks state and local AI policy, has identified [nearly a thousand bills introduced in state legislatures in 2025](https://www.multistate.ai/artificial-intelligence-ai-legislation) -- at least one in every state.  That's a big jump from 635 in all of 2024.

At the federal level, the Brennan Center reported that [in the 118th Congress, over 150 AI-related bills were introduced](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/artificial-intelligence-legislation-tracker); none were passed.  An [AI *Working Group* formed in January 2024](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409108) released [a report](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bipartisan_working_group_on_ai_staff_report.pdf) in July, and an [AI *Task Force* formed in February 2024](https://www.speaker.gov/2024/02/20/house-launches-bipartisan-task-force-on-artificial-intelligence/) delivered its [final report](https://www.speaker.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AI-Task-Force-Report-FINAL.pdf) in December.  A Senate AI Working group released [its report in May of 2024](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Roadmap_Electronic1.32pm.pdf), endorsing a number of AI-specific laws which, as far as I can tell, weren't passed.

The 119th Congress appears set to keep pace, despite the dumpster fire currently burning through American government.  There are two House subcommittees (under [Judiciary](https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/committee-judiciary-119th-congress/courts-intellectual-property-artificial) and [Financial Services](https://financialservices.house.gov/subcommittees/subcommittee/?IssueID=100098), a working group ([AI and Energy](https://fedorchak.house.gov/media/press-releases/fedorchak-announces-working-group-establish-legislative-framework-power-future),) and a [Senate AI Causus](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/artificial-intelligence-caucus).  And as of now, [at least 83 bills have been introduced that mention artificial intelligence](https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/legislation-text?wordsPhrases=%22Artificial+Intelligence%22&congresses%5B0%5D=119&legislationNumbers=&chamberOfOriginHouse=on&chamberOfOriginSenate=on&billTextVersionTypes%5B0%5D=IH&billTextVersionTypes%5B1%5D=IS&pageSize=250&q=%7B%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D).

So when you're calling your Members of Congress to encourage them to act on AI safety, where do you start?
